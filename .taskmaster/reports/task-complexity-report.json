			"expansionPrompt": "Use existing IndexerService and indexer-runner as the foundation. Add a new AutoIndexerService that uses ethers.WebSocketProvider to ws://127.0.0.1:8545 and subscribes to provider.on('block') with a 300–500ms debounce; on each tick, read last_synced_block from DB metadata and call indexer.syncHistoricalEvents(fromBlock). Gate to USE_LOCAL_NETWORK=true and localhost only. Add a CLI entry (backend/src/watch-indexer.ts) and npm scripts ('watch-indexer' and a root alias) that start the watcher with graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM handling. Implement simple reconnection/backoff for local WS, emit minimal logs (new block number + events processed), and update README with the local workflow.",
			"reasoning": "The repo already includes a full IndexerService (backend/src/services/indexer.service.ts) with real-time event listeners, historical sync, reconnection/backoff, and graceful shutdown, plus a runner (backend/src/indexer-runner.ts) and dev script (backend/package.json: dev:indexer). For local dev, the missing pieces are a lightweight block watcher that triggers incremental sync on new blocks via WebSocket to Hardhat, debounce logic, environment gating to localhost, and minimal logging. No major refactor is required; most plumbing (DB schema, metadata, event processing) exists. Testing is straightforward with a local Hardhat node and simulating WS drops."
